# Thermal Image Stitching for Close-Range Solar Panels

This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation for research on **improving thermal image stitching quality through optimized color map ranges**. The study is focused on close-range solar panel inspection.

## **Abstract**
Image stitching is challenging for thermal imaging due to limited visual features. This study investigates the effect of color map selection and range focusing on stitching quality. Key findings include the effectiveness of using focused ranges and specific color maps like Magma and Inferno.

## **Directory Structure**
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets used in this study.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and analysis.
- `results/`: Evaluation outputs, both data and plots.
- `docs/`: Research summary, poster, and documented meeting notes.

## **Key Findings**
- Focused color map ranges significantly improve thermal image stitching quality.
- Magma and Inferno color maps performed best across multiple evaluation metrics.

## **Acknowledgments**
This work was supported by IMPACTLab. The dataset was derived from close-range solar panel thermal images.
